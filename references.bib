abstract = {Graphical security models constitute a well-known, user-friendly way to represent the security of a system. These classes of models are used by security experts to identify vulnerabilities and assess the security of a system. The manual construction of these models can be tedious, especially for large enterprises. Consequently, the research community is trying to address this issue by proposing methods for the automatic generation of such models. In this work, we present a survey illustrating the current status of the automatic generation of two popular kinds of graphical security models: Attack Trees and Attack Graphs. The goal of this survey is to present the current methodologies used in the field, compare them, and present the challenges and future directions to the research community.}

  abstract = {Attack graphs provide compact representations of the attack paths an attacker can follow to compromise network resources from the analysis of network vulnerabilities and topology. These representations are a powerful tool for security risk assessment. Bayesian inference on attack graphs enables the estimation of the risk of compromise to the system’s components given their vulnerabilities and interconnections and accounts for multi-step attacks spreading through the system. While static analysis considers the risk posture at rest, dynamic analysis also accounts for evidence of compromise, for example, from Security Information and Event Management software or forensic investigation. However, in this context, exact Bayesian inference techniques do not scale well. In this article, we show how Loopy Belief Propagation—an approximate inference technique—can be applied to attack graphs and that it scales linearly in the number of nodes for both static and dynamic analysis, making such analyses viable for larger networks. We experiment with different topologies and network clustering on synthetic Bayesian attack graphs with thousands of nodes to show that the algorithm’s accuracy is acceptable and that it converges to a stable solution. We compare sequential and parallel versions of Loopy Belief Propagation with exact inference techniques for both static and dynamic analysis, showing the advantages and gains of approximate inference techniques when scaling to larger attack graphs.},
